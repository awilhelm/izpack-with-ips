The Available Panels
=====================

.. include:: include-top.inc

In this section I will introduce the various panels available in IzPack. The
usage for most is pretty simple and described right here. The more elaborate
ones are explained in more detail in the *Advanced Features* chapter or in
their own chapter. The panels are listed by their class name. This is the
name that must be used with the ``classname`` attribute. Please be aware that
the classname is Case-Sensitive, meaning that if the case from the
install.xml and the founded class file differs the installation will break.
In this last case, the installer will Throw an IllegalArgumentException in
the compiler if the declared class name in the xml file differs in case from
the founded class file.



HelloPanel
-----------

This panel welcomes the user by displaying the project name, the version, the
URL as well as the authors.

HTMLHelloPanel
---------------

This panel allows an HTML document to be used as the "welcome" panel.  It operates like the 'HTMLInfoPanel',
except that the resource name "HTMLHelloPanel" is used (i.e., "HTMLHelloPanel.info").

CheckedHelloPanel
------------------

This panel welcomes the user also by displaying the project name, the
version, the URL as well as the authors.


Additonal on windows the registry will be scanned for an entry which
determines that the product is already installed. If so, a dialog will be
shown which ask whether to install a second version of the product or not. If
you use this panel do not forget to add the `registry feature` into your
installation.


InfoPanel and HTMLInfoPanel
----------------------------

This is a kind of 'README' panel. It presents text of any length. The text is
specified by the ``(HTML)InfoPanel.info`` resource. Starting from IzPack
3.7.0, variables substitution is allowed.
To add an image to the HTMLInfoPanel you simply need to add a ressource to
your install.xml with an ID decided by you, then you can call this image by
refering it by this same ID.

In install.xml:

::

    <resources>
      <res src="logo.jpg" id="GHGHGH"/>
      .....

and in file.html:

::

    <img src="GHGHGH" />
    

Note that variables are being substituted in HTMLINfoPanel (e.g., ``$JINSTALL_PATH`` will be
replaced with the installation path).

You can define multiple HTMLInfoPanel with individual HTML texts by giving them a specific id. The resources are named ``HTMLInfoPanel.<panelid>`` :

::

    <resources>
    <res id="HTMLInfoPanel.readme" src="readme.html"/>
    <res id="HTMLInfoPanel.disclaimer" src="disclaimer.html"/>
    ...
    <resources>
    ...
    <panels>
    <panel classname="HTMLInfoPanel" id="readme" />
    <panel classname="HTMLInfoPanel" id="disclaimer" />
    ...
    </panels>

LicencePanel and HTMLLicencePanel
----------------------------------

Note:* There is a mistake in the name - it should be LicensePanel. In France
the word is Licence ... and one of my diploma is a 'Licence' so ...:* -)


Adding images to HTMLLicencePanel works exactly the same way as with
HTMLInfoPanel.

These panels can prompt the user to acknowledge a license agreement. They
block unless the user selects the 'agree' option. To specify the license
agreement text you have to use the `` (HTML)LicencePanel.licence`` resource.



PacksPanel
----------

Allows the user to select the packs he wants to install. This
panel also allows grouping of packs. Look at ``InstallationGroupPanel``
description to get more details.



ImgPacksPanel
--------------

This is the same as above, but for each pack a different picture is shown to
the user. The pictures are specified using the packImgId attribute for each
pack in the installer XML. The initial image will be the image of the first
pack that has a packImgId. The image is updated each time the user
(de)selects a pack that has a packImgId. Of course it's up to you to specify
an image for each pack in your installation with a unique packImgId. For
instance if you have 2 packs ``core`` and ``documentation`` (in this order),
and you assign both packs a packImgId that is identical to the pack's name
then the resource for ``core`` will be ``core`` and the resource for
``documentation`` will be ``documentation``. The initially shown image will
be the resource ``core``. The supported image formats depend on what your
client's JVM supports, but starting from J2SE 1.3, *GIF*, *JPEG* and *PNG*
are supported.



TreePacksPanel
--------------

This panel is very similar to ``PacksPanel``, but instead of simple list
of available packs, the tree-like list is constructed. By using the ``parent``
attribute of ``pack`` element, one can specify the hierarchy of the tree.
This panel supports grouping just like ``PacksPanel`` does.

example ::

        <installation version="1.0">
           (...)
            <panels>
                (...)
                <panel classname="TreePacksPanel"/>
                (...)
            </panels>

            <packs>
                <pack name="Base"
                    required="yes">
                    (...)
                </pack>
                <pack name="Themes"
                    required="no">
                    (...)
                </pack>
                <pack name="Black"
                    parent="Themes"
                    required="no">
                    (...)
                </pack>
                <pack name="Red"
                    parent="Themes"
                    required="no">
                    (...)
                </pack>
            </packs>
        </installation>

The result tree contains Base element with no children,
and Themes with two children named Black and Red.



TargetPanel
------------

This panel allows the user to select the installation path. It can be
customized with the following resources (they are text files containing the
path) :

-   ``TargetPanel.dir.f`` where f stands for the family (``mac, macosx,
    windows, unix``)
-   ``TargetPanel.dir`` : the directory name, instead of the software to
    install name
-   ``TargetPanel.dir.d`` where d is a "dynamic" name, as returned by the
    JavaTM virtual machine. You should write the name in lowercase and
    replace the spaces with underscores. For instance, you might want a
    different setting for Solaris and GNU/Linux which are both Unix-like
    systems. The resources would be ``TargetPanel.dir.sunos,
    TargetPanel.dir.linux``. You should have a Unix-resource in case it
    wouldn't work though.

The 'ShowCreateDirectoryMessage' variable may be used to suppress the
"target directory will be created" dialog. If the 'ShowCreateDirectoryMessage'
variable is set to "false" then the dialog will not be shown. If the 'ShowCreateDirectoryMessage'
variable is set to "true" or is not specified then the dialog will be shown if the target directory
does not exist. See the "Variables Element" section for information on how to specify variables.

DefaultTargetPanel
-------------------

The default installation directory is specified as in the TargetPanel (using
identical names (TargetPanel... not DefaultTargetPanel...), 
but will not allow the user to change the installation path. It can be used when
software must be installed in a specific location.



InstallPanel
------------

You should always have this one as it launches the installation process !



XInfoPanel
-----------

A panel showing text parsed by the variable substitutor. The text can be
specified through the ``XInfoPanel.info`` resource. This panel can be useful
when you have to show information after the installation process is completed
(for instance if the text contains the target path).



FinishPanel
------------

A ending panel, able to write automated installer information. For details
see the chapter on 'Advanced Features'.



SimpleFinishPanel
------------------

Same as ``FinishPanel``, but without the automated installer features. It is
aimed at making the life easier for end-users who will never encounter the
automated installer extra feature.



ShortcutPanel
--------------

This panel is used to create desktop shortcuts. For details on using the
ShortcutPanel see the chapter 'Desktop Shortcuts'.


UserInputPanel
---------------

This panel allows you to prompt the user for data. What the user is prompted
for is specified using an XML file which is included as a resource to the
installer.


CompilePanel
-------------

This panel allows you to compile just installed Java sourcecode. The details
for the compilation are specified using the resource
``CompilePanel.Spec.xml``. The XML file has the following format:

::

    <compilation>
      <global>
        <compiler>
          <choice value="$JAVA_HOME/bin/javac" />
          <choice value="jikes" />
        </compiler>
        <arguments>
          <choice value="-O -g:none" />
          <choice value="-O" />
          <choice value="-g" />
          <choice value="" />
        </arguments>
      </global>
      <jobs>
        <classpath add="$INSTALL_PATH/src/classes/" />
        <job name="optional name">
          <directory name="$INSTALL_PATH/src/classes/xyz" />
        </job>
        <job name="another job">
          <packdepency name="some package name" />
          <classpath sub="$INSTALL_PATH/" />
          <directory name="$INSTALL_PATH/src/classes/abc" />
          <file name="$INSTALL_PATH/some/file.java" />
        </job>
      </jobs>
    </compilation>


In theory, jobs can be nested but this has not been tested at all. A change
to the classpath within a job only affects this job and nested jobs. The
classpath should be specified before any files or directories.

The user can change the compiler to use and choose from some default
compilation options before compilation is started.

.. image:: ./compilePanel.png
    :alt: CompilePanel



ProcessPanel
-------------

This panel allows you to execute arbitrary files after installation. The
details for the compilation are specified using the resource
``ProcessPanel.Spec.xml``.

The XML file has the following format:

::

    <processing>
      <job name="do xyz">
        <os family="windows" />
        <executefile name="$INSTALL_PATH/scripts/xyz.bat">
          <arg>doit</arg><arg>$variable</arg>
        </executefile>
      </job>
      <job name="do xyz">
        <os family="unix" />
        <executefile name="$INSTALL_PATH/scripts/xyz.sh">
          <arg>doit</arg><arg>$variable</arg>
        </executefile>
      </job>
    </processing>


Each job may have an ``<os>`` attribute.

In addition to ``<arg>`` elements, the ``<executefile>`` element also accepts ``<env>`` elements to set variables in the environment of the target process. This can be useful if this process requires some environment variables, such as its installation directory, to work properly.
An ``<env>`` element has the following syntax: ``<env>variable=value</env>``. Note the value supports variable substitution, for example:
``<env>MY_PRODUCT_HOME=$INSTALL_PATH</env>``.

The ProcessPanel now also supports configurable behaviour for the panel's "Previous" and "Next" buttons. By adding ``<onFail>`` and ``<onSuccess>`` childs to the ``<processing>`` element, you define which buttons you want unlocked in case of failure and in case of success, respectively.

::

    <processing>
      <job name="do xyz">
        <executefile name="$INSTALL_PATH/scripts/xyz.bat">
          <arg>doit</arg><arg>$variable</arg>
        </executefile>
      </job>
      <onFail previous="true" next="false" />
      <onSuccess previous="true" next="true" condition="mycondition" />
      <onSuccess previous="false" next="true" condition="!mycondition" />
    </processing>

In the above example the job *do xyz* would be run, and if it returned with an error, the *next* button would be greyed out, and the button to the *previous* page would be enabled. If it returned without an error, the conditions of the ``<onSuccess>`` elements would be checked and the respective action would be taken.

``<executeclass>`` - Execute Java Classes
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

It is also possible to execute Java classes from this panel. Here's what this
feature author (Alex Bradley) says:

> i've been able to work around my requirements by extending the
``ProcessPanelWorker`` functionality to run user-specified classes. i've
extended the DTD of the `` ProcessPanel.Spec.xml`` to include a new element:

::

    <executeclass name="classname">
    <args..../>
    </executeclass>


> i've also added a new sub-class of ``Processable`` called ``executeclass``.
This will run a user-specified class in the context of the installer JVM with
a single method :

::

    run( AbstractUIProcessHandler handler, String[] args]);


> It can do everything i need and more. In particular, it allows me to write
a process extension and still be able to provide feedback to the user through
the feedback panel, and to add new functionality to the installer, after its
been built.

To use the executeclass facility, you will need to create a jar file with
your class and then add it to the installer with the `The Jar Merging
Element`.


``<executeForPack>`` - Only execute the job for certain packs
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

This can be be used to run the job only if the pack is enabled. For example,
the batch file will if either the ``Sources`` or ``Executables`` packs are
selected at install time.

::

    <processing>
     <job name="List files">
      <executeForPack name="Sources"/>
      <executeForPack name="Executables"/>
      <os family="windows" />
      <executefile name="$INSTALL_PATH\batch\ListFiles.bat" />
     </job>
    </processing>

``<logfiledir>`` - Output of the processPanel saved to a log
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

New with version 3.7 is the possibility to tee output that is written to the
ProcessPanel's textarea into an optional logfile. Using this feature is
pretty much straightforward, you only have to add a line in
``ProcessPanel.Spec.xml`` that will tell IzPack the location, where the
logfile should be stored.

Variable substitution is performed, so you can use ``$INSTALL_PATH`` as
example.

The name of the logfile is not (yet) configurable but should fit in most
cases. It will be named

::

    Install_V<$APP_VER>_<YYYY>-<MM>-<DD>_<hh>-<mm>-<ss>_<RandomId>.log


Here's an example:

::

    <processing>
      <logfiledir>$INSTALL_PATH</logfiledir>
      <job name="do xyz">
        <os family="windows" />
        <executefile name="$INSTALL_PATH/scripts/xyz.bat">
          <arg>doit</arg><arg>$variable</arg>
        </executefile>
    </processing>


This will generate a logfile named e.g.
``Install_V1.3_2004-11-08_19-22-20_43423.log`` located in ``$INSTALL_PATH``.

``ProcessPanelWorker`` will write all output that is directed to ``stdout``
and ``stderr`` to this file if ``ProcessPanel.Spec.xml`` contains the
``logfiledir`` entry.

Please note that this one file is used for storing the complete output of all
jobs and not a file for each job that is run.


JDKPathPanel
-------------

This panel allows the user to select a JDK path. The variable JAVA_HOME does
not point to a JDK, else to a JRE also the environment variable points to a
JDK. This is not a bug, this is the behavior of the VM. But some products
needs a JDK, for that this panel can be used. There is not only a selection
of the path else a validation. The validation will be done with the file
JDKPath/lib/tools.jar. If JAVA_HOME points to the VM which is placed in the
JDK, the directory will be used as default (JAVA_HOME/..). If there is the
variable

::

    JDKPathPanel.skipIfValid


defined with the value "yes", the panel will be skiped if the path is valid.
Additional it is possible to make a version control. If one or both variables

::

    JDKPathPanel.minVersion
    JDKPathPanel.maxVersion


are defined, only a JDK will be accepted which has a version in the range of
it. The detection is a little bit pragmatically, therefor it is possible,
that the detection can fail at some VMs. The values in the install.xml should
be like

::

    <variables>
      <variable name="JDKPathPanel.minVersion" value="1.4.1" />
      <variable name="JDKPathPanel.maxVersion" value="1.4.99" />
      <variable name="JDKPathPanel.skipIfValid" value="yes" />
    </variables>


If all is valid, the panels isValidated method sets the variable

::

    JDKPath


to the chosen path. Be aware, this variable exist not until the JDKPanel was
quitted once. At a secound activation, the default will be the last
selection.


SelectPrinterPanel
--------------------

This panel will look at the local printers installed and propose a list box
with all of them. Once chosen, the variable $SELECTED_PRINTER is set to the
user choice.


DataCheckPanel
---------------

DataCheckPanel is not for inclusion in an actuall install, but is a debugging
resource for developers writing custom panels or code to be included in
IzPack.
It creates a list of all the variables in InstallData, their values and a
list of all packs, indicating which are selected.
This list is printed to the console and appears in a scrollable text area on
the panel.
Put the panel in wherever you want to see any variables in InstallData or a
listing of the packs with a line like this in the <panels> section of
install.xml:

<panel classname="DataCheckPanel" />

It will automatically give you a full list of all the variables and packs
whenever the panel is made active.


SummaryPanel
-------------

This panel gives a summary of all shown panels. The best place for it is just
infront of the InstallPanel. Normaly it contains a warning that this is the
last panel before installation. The panel contains a scrollable HTML text
area to display the summary. The informations are collected from each panel
by calling the methods ``getSummaryCaption`` and ``getSummaryBody``.
``getSummaryCaption`` is implemented in ``IzPanel`` with a panel name default
text. ``getSummaryBody`` has to be implemented in all panels which should be
presented in the summary. If the secound method is not implemented, no
summary of this panel will be shown.

Additional it is possible to `log the contents` of the summary panel into a
HTML file.


InstallationGroupPanel
-----------------------

This Panel groups the pack together. A panel which displays the available
*installGroups* found on the packs to allow the user to select a subset of
the packs based on the pack *installGroups* attribute. This panel will be
skipped if there are no pack elements with an *installGroups* attribute. For
example ::

        <installation version="1.0">
           (...)
            <panels>
                (...)
                <panel classname="InstallationGroupPanel"/>
                <panel classname="PacksPanel"/>
                (...)
            </panels>

            <packs>
                <pack name="Base"
                    installGroups="Group1"
                    required="yes">
                    (...)
                </pack>
                <pack name="Docs"
                    installGroups="Group1,Group2"
                    required="no">
                    (...)
                </pack>
                <pack name="Sources"
                    installGroups="Group3,Group2"
                    required="no">
                    (...)
                </pack>
            </packs>
        </installation>
        
In above example when InstallationGroupPanel is displayed,
it contains three radios named Group1, Group2 and Group3. Depending
on what user selects, the respective Packs will be displayed in
PacksPanel. InstallationGroupPanel will look for a description
corresponding to the key
"InstallationGroupPanel.description.Group1",
"InstallationGroupPanel.description.Group2" etc in installation
langpacks and variables and displays this description for each of
the Group_i.

You may also define a sortKey in the variables section of the installer.xml
to define an alternative sorting. The default sorting is based on the Group
Name.

Here is an example for alternative sorting of groups: ::

        (...)
        <variables>
           (...)
            <variable
            name="InstallationGroupPanel.sortKey.Group2" value="A"/>
            <variable
            name="InstallationGroupPanel.sortKey.Group1" value="B"/>
            <variable
            name="InstallationGroupPanel.sortKey.Group3" value="C"/>
        </variables>
        (...)

By default, your group name (and description) are displayed as-is in the
installer. If you want them to be localized, add localized names to your
``packsLang.xml`` resources. The string ID has to be 
InstallationGroupPanel.group.```group_name``.

Here is an example to localize groups into French (these lines have to be put
in your ``packsLang.xml_fra`` resource) :
::

<str id="InstallationGroupPanel.group.Core" txt="Noyau de l'application" />
<str id="InstallationGroupPanel.description.Core" txt="Fichiers principaux, indispensables au fonctionnement de l'application" />
<str id="InstallationGroupPanel.group.Samples" txt="Fichiers d'exemple" />
<str id="InstallationGroupPanel.description.Samples" txt="Fichiers d'exemples" />

If you want to add html markup to those strings, add ``.html`` at the end
of the string id (after the group name).


UserPathPanel
--------------

This panel allows the user to select a path similar to the installation path. 
Like the installation path, this panel will allow the directory to be created
if it does not already exist.  It can also be pre-loaded with a path and 
set to only display if a certain pack is selected using the following variables:

::

    <variable name="UserPathPanelVariable" value="@{default.dest.dir.sql}"/>
    <variable name="UserPathPanelDependsName" value="Install Database Server"/>

Final path selection can be accessed using the variable "UserPathPanelVariable".

Messages for the UserPathPanel can be customized by creating a custom lang pack and
overriding the following values (attribute values wrapped for readability):

::

    <str id="UserPathPanel.required" txt="The chosen directory should exist."/>
    <str id="UserPathPanel.info" txt="Select the path: "/>
    <str id="UserPathPanel.browse" txt="Browse"/>
    <str id="UserPathPanel.exists_warn" txt="The directory already exists! 
    		Are you sure you want to install here and possibly overwrite existing files?"/>
    <str id="UserPathPanel.empty_target" txt="You have not specified a target 
    		location! Is this correct?"/>
    <str id="UserPathPanel.createdir" txt="The target directory will be created: " />
    <str id="UserPathPanel.nodir"  txt="This file is not a directory! Please 
    		choose a directory!"/>
    <str id="UserPathPanel.notwritable" txt="This directory can not be written! 
    		Please choose another directory!"/>
